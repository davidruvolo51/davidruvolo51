# Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm interested in web-based applications that communicate research results using interactive visualizations. I build web apps and tools for use in research and clinical environments. My favorite tools are R, R's Shiny app framework, React, D3, and more.

## Current Projects ðŸ˜Ž

ðŸ¥³ [rheroicons](https://github.com/davidruvolo51/rheroicons) is now on CRAN!

I like to experiment with web-based applications using R. The repository [shinyAppTutorials](https://github.com/davidruvolo51/shinyAppTutorials) contains a series of examples for building custom Shiny applications. Checkout the accompanying site [davidruvolo51.github.io/shinytutorials/](https://davidruvolo51.github.io/shinytutorials/).

Here are some of the latest things that I have been experimenting with.

I've also been working on integrating Frontend, R, and application bundlers.
