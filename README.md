# Hello 👋

I'm interested in web-based applications that communicate research results using interactive visualizations. I build web apps and tools for use in research and clinical environments. My favorite tools are R, R's Shiny app framework, React, D3, and more.

## Current Projects 😎

Here are some of the latest things that I have been experimenting with.

- 📖 [Updating Publications in the cloud: An experiment with GitHub Actions](https://github.com/davidruvolo51/update-publications-workflow)

I've also been working on integrating Frontend, R, and application bundlers.

- [React + Express + Node + Webpack](https://github.com/davidruvolo51/r-react-demo)
- [Vue + Plumber + Vite](https://github.com/davidruvolo51/r-vue-app)
- [React + Plumber + Parcel](https://github.com/davidruvolo51/r-plumber-app)

## Latest Posts 📓

I like to experiment with web-based applications using R and I write about it from time to time.
