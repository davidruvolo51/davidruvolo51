# Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm interested in web-based applications that communicate research results using interactive visualizations. I build web apps and tools for use in research and clinical environments. My favorite tools are R, R's Shiny app framework, React, D3, and more.

I like to experiment with web-based applicantions using R, and I write about it from time to time.
