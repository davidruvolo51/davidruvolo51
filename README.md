# Hello 👋

I'm interested in web-based applications that communicate research results using interactive visualizations. I build web apps and tools for use in research and clinical environments. My favorite tools are R, R's Shiny app framework, React, D3, and more.

## Current Projects 😎

Here are some of the things that I am working on. For more information, checkout my R universe page [davidruvolo51.r-universe.dev](https://davidruvolo51.r-universe.dev]
